## Code Examples

### Minimal Integration (3 lines)
```kotlin
val securityGuard = SecurityGuard.getInstance(context)
securityGuard.enableFeature(SecurityFeature.MOTION_DETECTION)
// That's it! Motion detection is now active
```

### Complete Integration
```kotlin
// Initialize
val securityGuard = SecurityGuard.getInstance(context)

// Configure
val config = SecurityGuardConfig(
    enableNotifications = true,
    alarmDuration = 5000L,
    motionSensitivity = 600,
    clapSensitivity = 6500,
    lowBatteryThreshold = 15,
    vibrationEnabled = true
)
securityGuard.configure(config)

// Set callback
securityGuard.setCallback(object : SecurityGuardCallback {
    override fun onSecurityEvent(feature: SecurityFeature, message: String) {
        Log.d("Security", "Event: $message")
    }
    
    override fun onSecurityError(feature: SecurityFeature, error: Throwable) {
        Log.e("Security", "Error", error)
    }
})

// Enable features
securityGuard.enableFeatures(
    SecurityFeature.CHARGER_DETECTION,
    SecurityFeature.MOTION_DETECTION,
    SecurityFeature.CLAP_DETECTION
)

// Later... disable when done
securityGuard.stopAll()
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Anti-Theft App
```kotlin
// Enable motion and charger detection
securityGuard.enableFeatures(
    SecurityFeature.MOTION_DETECTION,
    SecurityFeature.CHARGER_DETECTION
)
// Device will alarm if moved or charger removed
```

### 2. Phone Finder App
```kotlin
// Enable clap detection
securityGuard.enableFeature(SecurityFeature.CLAP_DETECTION)
// User can find phone by clapping
```

### 3. Battery Management App
```kotlin
// Configure custom battery threshold
val config = SecurityGuardConfig(lowBatteryThreshold = 20)
securityGuard.configure(config)
securityGuard.enableFeature(SecurityFeature.BATTERY_MONITOR)
// Get alerts at custom battery levels
```

### 4. Parental Control App
```kotlin
// Monitor all connections
securityGuard.enableFeatures(
    SecurityFeature.WIFI_MONITOR,
    SecurityFeature.HANDSFREE_DETECTION
)
// Track connectivity changes
```

```

### 2. Request Permissions Properly
```kotlin
// Check before enabling CLAP_DETECTION
if (hasPermission(RECORD_AUDIO)) {
    securityGuard.enableFeature(SecurityFeature.CLAP_DETECTION)
} else {
    requestPermission(RECORD_AUDIO)
}
```

### 3. Handle Lifecycle
```kotlin
override fun onPause() {
    super.onPause()
    // Optionally disable features when app is in background
    securityGuard.disableFeature(SecurityFeature.PROXIMITY_DETECTION)
}

override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    // Re-enable when app comes to foreground
    securityGuard.enableFeature(SecurityFeature.PROXIMITY_DETECTION)
}
```

### 4. Clean Up Resources
```kotlin
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    // Stop all features if no longer needed
    securityGuard.stopAll()
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Permissions
- All permissions are documented
- Runtime permissions are properly requested
- Microphone is only used for clap detection
- No data is collected or transmitted
- No internet permission required

### Data Storage
- Configuration stored in SharedPreferences
- No sensitive data stored
- No external data transmission
- All processing is local

## Testing

### Unit Testing
Each service can be tested independently:
```kotlin
@Test
fun testChargerDetection() {
    val service = ChargerDetectionService()
    // Test service behavior
}
```

### Integration Testing
The demo app serves as comprehensive integration tests for all features.

### Manual Testing
1. Build demo app
2. Toggle each feature
3. Trigger events (unplug charger, clap, move device, etc.)
4. Verify alarms and notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Feature Not Working
1. Check permissions are granted
2. Check Logcat for error messages
3. Verify sensor availability (some devices lack certain sensors)
4. Ensure feature is enabled via `isFeatureEnabled()`

### No Alarm Sound
1. Check device volume is not muted
2. Verify notification permission granted
3. Check custom sound URI is valid
4. Try default alarm by setting `customAlarmSound = null`

### High Battery Usage
1. Disable unused features
2. Adjust sensitivity thresholds
3. Increase cooldown durations
4. Disable features when app is in background
